Hightouch’s mission is to empower everyone to take action on their data. &nbsp;We’ve pioneered the Composable Customer Data Platform (CDP), which helps companies use their own data warehouse to collect, prepare, and activate customer data for marketing personalization and business operations. Traditionally, acting on data has required engineering time and bandwidth, and left most business users stuck with charts and reports that are unable to take automated action on their data. With Hightouch, every business user, without writing any code, can activate data to streamline critical processes, improve marketing performance, and scale operations.

Our team operates with a focus on making a meaningful impact for our customers. We believe in approaching challenges with a first principles thinking mindset, moving quickly and embracing our value of efficient execution, and treating each other with compassion and kindness. We look for team members that are strong commu

Who We Are
Cogent Biosciences is a publicly traded biotechnology company developing real solutions to treat genetically driven diseases. With a focus on rational drug discovery and development, we are leveraging validated biology to advance precision therapies designed to address the true underlying drivers of disease and provide real hope for patients. Cogent’s lead therapeutic candidate, bezuclastinib (CGT9486), is a precision kinase inhibitor designed to selectively and potently inhibit the KIT D816V mutation. This mutation is responsible for driving a rare and serious condition called Systemic Mastocytosis (SM), which can severely impact many different tissues and organs in the body. We are also studying CGT9486 to treat advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), which have a strong dependence on oncogenic KIT signaling. We are currently enrolling two Phase 2 clinical trials for patients with SM and a global Phase 3 trial for GIST patients.

At Goldsky, our vision is simple: Build the most powerful data platform for Web3. ☀️
Blockchains will enable a new era of unique onchain experiences and applications. However, today it’s impossible to build high-quality products due to the difficulties of processing onchain data effectively. This complexity is only increasing as more chains and smart contracts are deployed across the ecosystem. Teams are forced to build complex data infrastructure in-house, distracting them from focusing on their core product.
Goldsky bridges this gap by making it seamless for developers to power their applications with realtime onchain data. Our infrastructure powers hundreds of projects across the industry building rich, instant, data-driven experiences.
We’ve raised over $20M from Dragonfly Capital, Felicis Ventures, prominent players in the industry such as 0x Labs, Uniswap Labs, and Protocol Labs, and angel investors including Elad Gil, Plaid founders Zach Perret and Will

We make eco-friendly products and donate 50% of our profits to provide clean water and help build toilets for the billions of people who lack proper access. So far, we’ve contributed over $13.3 million AUD (roughly $8.9 million USD) to fund sanitation projects around the globe. Basically, we’re really good at doing good.

About Goldsky

At Goldsky, our vision is simple but powerful: build the data platform for web3.

Blockchains will enable a new era of unique digital experiences and applications. However, today it’s impossible to build high-quality products due to the difficulties of processing on-chain data … and this complexity is only increasing as more chains and smart contracts are deployed. Teams are forced to build data infrastructure in-house in order to build their product, distracting them from their core focus.

Goldsky bridges this gap by automating the creation of end-to-end data pipelines. Our data infrastructure enables hundreds of teams across the industry to build rich, instant, data-driven experiences using on-chain data at blazing fast speeds.

We’ve raised over $20M from Dragonfly Capital, Felicis Ventures, prominent players in the industry such as 0x Labs, Uniswap Labs, and Protocol Labs, and angel investors including Elad Gil, Plaid founders Zach Perret and William

At Goldsky, our vision is simple: Build the most powerful data platform for Web3. ☀️

Blockchains will enable a new era of unique onchain experiences and applications. However, today it’s impossible to build high-quality products due to the difficulties of processing onchain data effectively. This complexity is only increasing as more chains and smart contracts are deployed across the ecosystem. Teams are forced to build complex data infrastructure in-house, distracting them from focusing on their core product.

Goldsky bridges this gap by making it seamless for developers to power their applications with realtime onchain data. Our infrastructure powers hundreds of projects across the industry building rich, instant, data-driven experiences.

We’ve raised over $20M from Dragonfly Capital, Felicis Ventures, prominent players in the industry such as 0x Labs, Uniswap Labs, and Protocol Labs, and angel investors including Elad Gil, Plaid founders Zach Perret

About Aztec

At Aztec, our goal is to add privacy to Ethereum.

In the current public blockchain paradigm, users and entities unknowingly broadcast data in the public, compromising privacy and security to get trustlessness.

Not only are unencrypted blockchains inherently privacy-exposing, they require significant redundancy to compute and verify the legitimacy of transactions.

Implementing scalable encryption in a public blockchain paradigm requires cutting-edge math and engineering. Thankfully, our team of scientists and engineers invented Plonk, the industry-standard zkSNARK, and Noir, the universal language of zero knowledge.

Now, we’re building a first of its kind Layer 2 with private smart contracts. This requires new cryptographic primitives, a zero-knowledge DSL for writing contracts, a privacy-friendly execution environment, a carefully designed set of circuits that prove the validity of the chain to L1, a decentralized block-building and proving mechanism, and

About Glean
&nbsp;


We’re on a mission to make knowledge work faster and more humane. We believe that AI will fundamentally transform how people work. In the future, everyone will work in tandem with expert AI assistants who find knowledge, create and synthesize information, and execute work. These assistants will free people up to focus on the higher-level, creative aspects of their work.
We’re building a system of intelligence for every company in the world. On the surface, you can think of it as Google + ChatGPT for the enterprise. Under the hood, our platform is the connective tissue between AI and knowledge. It brings all of a company’s knowledge together, understands it at a deep level, provides industry-leading search relevance over it, and connects it to generative AI agents and applications.

We power the world's largest finance and fintech institutions and lower the barrier of entry for small startups, gaining over 4000 users during our first year of launch. Our team consists of former data users from firms like Two Sigma, Belvedere, Pico, Flow Traders, and Tower Research.

We offer health, dental, disability, and life insurance benefits, as well as 401(k) matching and visa sponsorships for full-time employees. We accommodate 100% remote work, with teammates living around the globe and paid in their local currency.&nbsp;

Consumers are increasingly asking if the brands they trust are “sustainable” – that is, produced under acceptable social, economic and environmental practices. Companies have responded by setting targets for becoming “100% sustainable”. However, traditional approaches for verifying sustainability face challenges reaching farmers that are too small, too remote, or informally organized.&nbsp;Enveritas (www.enveritas.org) is building solutions for smallholder coffee farmers that are currently beyond the reach of existing sustainability certification or verification approaches.&nbsp;We have developed a rigorous, scalable and transparent method of verification that works in this “underserved space.” This verification is the backbone of our Responsible Sourcing platform that helps companies meet their sustainability targets by investing in the areas that need it most.&nbsp;

About JFF&nbsp;

Jobs for the Future (JFF) drives transformation of the U.S. education and workforce systems to achieve equitable economic advancement for all. Seeing that millions of people are unfairly shut out of quality jobs and the chance for a better life, our goal is to align education, workforce, and employment changemakers toward a shared North Star: By 2033, 75 million people facing systemic barriers to advancement will work in quality jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

To achieve that goal, we design solutions, scale best practices, influence policy and action, and invest in innovation. With a staff of more than 300 people across the country working remotely and in offices in Boston (headquarters), Washington, DC, and Oakland, California, we operate at the national, state, and local levels, forging deep partnerships with employers, investors, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and education and workforce development providers to break down barriers and reimagine what’s possible.&nbsp;&nbs

Human Interest is on a mission to ensure that people in all lines of work have access to retirement benefits.&nbsp;

Nearly half of all working Americans are not saving enough for their future. Too often it’s because they are employed by a company that doesn’t offer a retirement plan. Human Interest is changing that by making it affordable and accessible for small and medium-sized businesses to offer employees a path to financial independence through retirement savings.

We’re a high-growth tech company changing the retirement industry. We’ve raised $500M and are backed by leading investors. Most recently, by funding from BlackRock as well as many other top investors: TPG (The Rise Fund) with SoftBank led our Series D, Glynn Capital, NewView Capital, USVP, Wing, Uncork, and others.

Who We Are:&nbsp;


Technology has transformed almost every single aspect of our lives. Yet in biopharma, it still takes 12 years to develop a drug. Even today, thousands of diseases affecting hundreds of millions of people have no effective treatment. Accelerating the pace of bringing effective, new medicines to patients is one of the greatest opportunities for humanity.&nbsp;Our mission is to develop better drugs, faster using technology. We have built an end-to-end technology-driven drug discovery platform centered around one of the field’s largest human genomics databases in neuroscience. We use machine learning to map the complex causes of disease and turn those insights into promising drug candidates on our internal biology and chemistry platforms. We are developing drugs to treat some of the biggest medical challenges today: ALS, Parkinson’s disease, and dementia.

About Glean

We’re on a mission to bring people the knowledge they need to make a difference in the world.&nbsp;

Glean was founded by a seasoned team of former Google search and Facebook engineers, who wondered why we don’t have an easier way of finding what we need at work. In our personal lives, we have tools to help us find pretty much whatever we need. Why don’t we have that at work? And that was the beginning of Glean.

Glean searches across all your company’s apps to help you find exactly what you need and discover the things you should know. We’re a diverse team of curious and creative people who want to help each other get big things done—so we can help other teams do the same.&nbsp;

We're backed by some of the Valley's leading venture capitalists—including Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, and General Catalyst—and have assembled a world-class team with senior leadership experience at Google, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox, Rubrik, Uber, Intercom, Pint

Founded in 2006, One Acre Fund supplies 1 million smallholder farmers with the agricultural services they need to make their farms vastly more productive. Our 8,000+ team is drawn from diverse backgrounds and professions. With operations across six core countries in Africa, we make farmers more prosperous by providing quality farm supplies on credit, delivered within walking distance of farmers’ homes, and agricultural training to improve harvests. On average, the farmers we serve harvest 50 percent more food after working with One Acre Fund.&nbsp;

To learn more about our work, take a look at our Why Work Here blog for more information.
About the Role
The success of the One Acre Fund model has resulted in an operation that started by serving approximately 30 farmers in 2007 to more than 750,000 farmers in 2022. One Acre Fund believes that this can be replicated within the coffee sector in collaboration with the important coffee sector partners in Rwanda.

About us:

Here at Tarro we build products that empower small brick and mortar restaurants by liberating them of the operational burden of running their business. We accomplish this by providing a frictionless connection between them and their customers through our multi-product ecosystem offering AI-enabled order taking, delivery enablement, payment solutions, and point-of-sale software. At Tarro, we use a combination of bits (technology) and atoms (people) to solve real world problems facing small business owners.

We obsess over placing our customers first and working backwards from there. When our customers succeed, we succeed. The restaurant industry in the US is over a $1 trillion total addressable market (TAM), but remains relatively underserved by technology. Large chains are able to afford expensive tech that gives them a huge advantage; we believe that small restaurant owners deserve access to the same technologies at an affordable price.&nbsp;

About Glean

We’re on a mission to bring people the knowledge they need to make a difference in the world.&nbsp;

Glean was founded by a seasoned team of former Google search and Facebook engineers, who wondered why we don’t have an easier way of finding what we need at work. In our personal lives, we have tools to help us find pretty much whatever we need. Why don’t we have that at work? And that was the beginning of Glean.

Glean searches across all your company’s apps to help you find exactly what you need and discover the things you should know. We’re a diverse team of curious and creative people who want to help each other get big things done—so we can help other teams do the same.&nbsp;

We're backed by some of the Valley's leading venture capitalists—including Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, and General Catalyst—and have assembled a world-class team with senior leadership experience at Google, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox, Rubrik, Uber, Intercom, Pint

We make eco-friendly products and donate 50% of our profits to provide clean water and help build toilets for the billions of people who lack proper access. So far, we’ve contributed over $13.3 million AUD (roughly $8.9 million USD) to fund sanitation projects around the globe. Basically, we’re really good at doing good.&nbsp;

With hubs in Australia, the Philippines, China, the US, UK and Europe, our amazing team of 200+ work to make the biggest possible impact for people and the planet.

About Aztec

At Aztec, our goal is to add privacy to Ethereum.

In the current public blockchain paradigm, users and entities unknowingly broadcast data in the public, compromising privacy and security to get trustlessness.

Not only are unencrypted blockchains inherently privacy-exposing, they require significant redundancy to compute and verify the legitimacy of transactions.

Implementing scalable encryption in a public blockchain paradigm requires cutting-edge math and engineering. Thankfully, our team of scientists and engineers invented Plonk, the industry-standard zkSNARK, and Noir, the universal language of zero knowledge.

Now, we’re building a first of its kind Layer 2 with private smart contracts. This requires new cryptographic primitives, a zero-knowledge DSL for writing contracts, a privacy-friendly execution environment, a carefully designed set of circuits that prove the validity of the chain to L1, a decentralized block-building and proving mechanism, and

Neon is aiming to be the go-to platform if you need a serverless Postgres with additional features like branching and scaling, to name a couple. Currently we are serving 750k databases and we want to grow that number, along with delivering more features without compromising from reliability and scalability. This is where our SRE team comes into the picture.

The SRE team is responsible for managing Neon’s multi-region, multi-cloud deployment in close collaboration with the broader engineering team. All the features we want to implement can only reach our customers if the changes are delivered reliably, which means the SRE team plays a significant role in defining our pace of development.

About Aztec

At Aztec, our goal is to add privacy to Ethereum.

In the current public blockchain paradigm, users and entities unknowingly broadcast data in the public, compromising privacy and security to get trustlessness.

Not only are unencrypted blockchains inherently privacy-exposing, they require significant redundancy to compute and verify the legitimacy of transactions.

Implementing scalable encryption in a public blockchain paradigm requires cutting-edge math and engineering. Thankfully, our team of scientists and engineers invented Plonk, the industry-standard zkSNARK, and Noir, the universal language of zero knowledge.

Now, we’re building a first of its kind Layer 2 with private smart contracts. This requires new cryptographic primitives, a zero-knowledge DSL for writing contracts, a privacy-friendly execution environment, a carefully designed set of circuits that prove the validity of the chain to L1, a decentralized block-building and proving mechanism, and

Human Interest is on a mission to ensure that people in all lines of work have access to retirement benefits.&nbsp;

Nearly half of all working Americans are not saving enough for their future. Too often it’s because they are employed by a company that doesn’t offer a retirement plan. Human Interest is changing that by making it affordable and accessible for small and medium-sized businesses to offer employees a path to financial independence through retirement savings.

We’re a high-growth tech company changing the retirement industry. We’ve raised $500M and are backed by leading investors. Most recently, by funding from BlackRock as well as many other top investors: TPG (The Rise Fund) with SoftBank led our Series D, Glynn Capital, NewView Capital, USVP, Wing, Uncork, and others.

At Trunk, our mission is to help teams create high-quality software quickly. Merge conflicts, poor code quality or consistency, flaky tests, and dozens of other distractions quickly drain the productivity and morale of those teams. Engineering teams that can stay focused on designing, implementing, and delivering software will build magical, high-quality projects - and they will be happier doing it. We're building the tools that empower teams to land code faster and develop happier.


We are building the foundation for a modern software engineering team. Our founders started this journey in 2021 and have designed, delivered, and scaled software at some of the world's largest and fastest-growing tech companies - Uber, Google, YouTube, and Microsoft. We're building a game-changing company, and we hope you are excited to be a part of that audacious goal.

Head of Marketing


We’re looking for an incredible Head of Marketing to level up Caldera’s brand among developers, Web3 projects, and the broader Web3 and Ethereum community. As Head of Marketing, you’ll grow our marketing function from the ground up, and will have significant ownership over our marketing strategy.

About Caldera


Caldera enables dynamic, scalable blockchain experiences. Currently, dapps that are deployed to general-purpose blockchain compete with thousands of other applications for space on the network — this can lead to congestion and high fees or even network outages.


That’s where we come in. We’re building software that makes it easy for the most innovative blockchain applications to launch their own ultra-performant blockchains (rollups), enabling applications to own their ecosystem, scale to millions of users, and provide a superior user experience

Human Interest is on a mission to ensure that people in all lines of work have access to retirement benefits.&nbsp;

Nearly half of all working Americans are not saving enough for their future. Too often it’s because they are employed by a company that doesn’t offer a retirement plan. Human Interest is changing that by making it affordable and accessible for small and medium-sized businesses to offer employees a path to financial independence through retirement savings.

We’re a high-growth tech company changing the retirement industry. We’ve raised $500M and are backed by leading investors. Most recently, by funding from BlackRock as well as many other top investors: TPG (The Rise Fund) with SoftBank led our Series D, Glynn Capital, NewView Capital, USVP, Wing, Uncork, and others.

We started by building a powerful network for communication. ClassDojo’s flagship app is the 1 communication app connecting K-8 teachers, children, and families globally. Teachers use it to share what’s happening throughout the day through photos, videos, and messages that make parents feel like they’re there. It’s actively used in over 95% of US schools, reaching over 50 million children in 180 countries, with a team of just around 200 people [1]. We are now beginning to use this network to give kids the best learning experiences in the world, far beyond those a standard school can provide.

Our team comprises the most talented, entrepreneurial, and innovative teammates from around the world, with experience in education and large scale consumer internet companies, including Instagram, Netflix, Dropbox, Stripe, Uber, Y Combinator, and more.

OUR STORY
Quince was started to challenge the existing idea that nice things should cost a lot. Our mission was simple: create an item of equal or greater quality than the leading luxury brands and sell them at a much lower price.

WE FOCUS ON THE ESSENTIALS.  From the perfect crewneck sweater to hotel quality sheets, we're all about high quality essentials that bring enjoyment to daily life.

Human Interest is on a mission to ensure that people in all lines of work have access to retirement benefits.&nbsp;

Nearly half of all working Americans are not saving enough for their future. Too often it’s because they are employed by a company that doesn’t offer a retirement plan. Human Interest is changing that by making it affordable and accessible for small and medium-sized businesses to offer employees a path to financial independence through retirement savings.

We’re a high-growth tech company changing the retirement industry. We’ve raised $500M and are backed by leading investors. Most recently, by funding from BlackRock as well as many other top investors: TPG (The Rise Fund) with SoftBank led our Series D, Glynn Capital, NewView Capital, USVP, Wing, Uncork, and others.

We’re a high-growth tech company changing the retirement industry. We’ve raised $500M and are backed by leading investors.

Our mission
The trucking and logistics industry provides the backbone of the economy. But the payments infrastructure on which it runs is broken. For the hard-working men and women of this sector, the existing suite of payment tools is outdated, difficult to use, prone to fraud, and saddled with shady fee structures. The incumbent players in this space often overlook the economic and practical needs of this user base. 


We're changing that. AtoB is building Stripe for Transportation — modernizing the payments infrastructure for trucking and logistics. Supply chains rely on the timely movement of capital to function efficiently. Our end game is a world in which that capital movement occurs fairly, smoothly, and without delay. As we pursue that end game, we aim to center our customers in every way — offering them world-class customer experience and building products that work with and around the unique constraints of their daily lives. We build for fleet managers in the office

About the Initiative


Schoolhouse.world is launching a new initiative in partnership with several universities called Dialogues to encourage and facilitate civil dialogue among high schoolers across the U.S. and the world. The problem is clear: society is increasingly polarized, American colleges have seen a breakdown of dialogue between students, and even our democracy is at risk. Our future depends on the next generation being able to listen to and learn from one another, and to not turn away from dialogue.


Schoolhouse, founded in 2020 by Sal Khan, is a leading free, non-profit educational platform for high schoolers to connect with each other over live Zoom sessions. While the focus has been on academic tutoring until now, Dialogues will expand these interactions to also include students engaging in conversations on contentious issues with others of the opposing view. The emphasis will be on the most divisive topics of the day: Israel-Palestine, abortion, Biden vs. Trump,

Yuga Labs is a web3 company exploring big ideas in identity, ownership, utility, and interoperability to push the crypto and NFT space forward. As The Defiant recently said, ""The story of Yuga Labs is one where the improbable has become reality in the blink of an eye."" Since debuting with our flagship collection Bored Ape Yacht Club in April 2021, we’ve created new IP for the ape ecosystem (Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Bored Ape Kennel Club), acquired other top collections (CryptoPunks and Meebits), and pulled off successful events (ApeFest) and partnerships (Rolling Stone). And we made both web3 and gaming history — the biggest NFT mint ever followed by a game demo with record-breaking synchronized player participation —  for our newest initiative, Otherside.

We believe Ethereum has the potential to solve some of humanity’s most crucial coordination issues. Since our initial inception as a research group, we have sought to scale both its technology and values.

At present, the most pressing bottleneck to the growth of Ethereum is its performance and scalability. We are building the most elegant solution to this problem. We do this in the open (under an MIT open source license) because we believe in open source innovation and its ability to accelerate growth.

OP Labs is building Optimism mainnet, and by extension, the infrastructure that powers all OP-Stack chains. We are improving Ethereum’s performance by orders of magnitude and donating the profits from doing so to funding Ethereum public goods. By operating as a Public Benefit Corporation, OP Labs can align its incentives with the public good and take positive-sum steps toward a sustainable future for the internet.

About Us

Parity is one of the world's most experienced core blockchain infrastructure companies, having built and pioneered some of the most advanced technologies in the blockchain sector. Parity was founded by Dr. Gavin Wood, co-founder and former CTO of Ethereum, the primary engineer behind the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), inventor of the Solidity programming language, and primary author of the Ethereum Yellowpaper.

Based in Berlin, London, and Lisbon, Parity has built clients for Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Zcash and has pioneered a completely new, next-generation blockchain protocol with Polkadot and the framework it’s built with, Substrate. Parity builds the open-source technologies needed to power an unstoppable, decentralised web—known as Web3—and helps developers and organisations implement and build upon the Web3 tech stack.

Argent aims to be crypto’s defining company: the first to bring the benefits of self-custody to a global audience. Giving people control of their assets and identity, and helping them to enjoy new economic opportunities.

To do this we’ve built the first smart wallet. As different from traditional wallets as smart phones were to 90’s phones. Argent is easier, safer, cheaper, and greener.

As a company, we’ve raised a $40m Series B from Paradigm, Index Ventures and Creandum, putting us in a strong financial position with 4 years of runway.

We work remotely across Europe, prioritizing autonomy and flexibility. And it’s a particularly exciting time to join as we’re launching new breakthrough products on Starknet.

The Opportunity

We’re looking for founders to build the next generation of applications focused on the real world.

You’ve heard of the Internet of Things. That is fast being replaced by the Economy of Things and IoT Apps are being replaced by EoT Apps, or dApps — decentralized applications.

EoT Labs is leading the transition from one era to the next. We are the team behind peaq, the go-to blockchain for real-world applications — which you can think of as the infrastructure for the Economy of Things. There are tens of applications being launched on peaq right now, and tens of applications — or DePINs, Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks — as they’re now known, that need founders to run with the idea, and build the future.

We've got 10+ ventures with the potential to revolutionize industries and positively impact hundreds of millions of people -- and now we're looking for the right people to take them to the moon. We've got business plans, funding,

About us

Flashbots started in 2020 as a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities and existential risks posed by Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). Since then, we have had an immense impact on the world of crypto through mev-geth, Flashbots Protect, MEV-Boost, MEV-Share, our open research and soon-to-be SUAVE.


Our mission is clear: illuminate, democratize and distribute.
We seek to ensure that the value created on decentralized, public blockchains is transparent and distributed. We do this by conducting cutting-edge research, building mission-critical products, and coordinating a diverse community with competing interests.

Our vibe is astro-pirate-punk: irreverent, anarchic, excellent, autonomous. We’re explorers, hackers, builders, thinkers. We are relaxed, composed, and at ease in the world, but beneath our suave exterior, we do not have the time or inclination to be anything but the best.

We are building the future of search. For the past two decades, we have navigated the internet through search engines like Google. With every passing year, however, these search engines have become noisier and less reliable. The ten blue links they provide have transformed into sponsored posts, advertisements, and clunky, ad-filled blogs.

We are building the future of search. For the past two decades, we have navigated the internet through search engines like Google. With every passing year, however, these search engines have become noisier and less reliable. The ten blue links they provide have transformed into sponsored posts, advertisements, and clunky, ad-filled blogs.

The future of search provides immediate answers, not links, from quality sources across the web. It explores the corners of the internet in real-time - from academic research to news articles. The answers are derived from trusted sources and include transparent citations.

Perplexity is the world’s first answer engine: redefining search with answers to all of your questions. We are one of the fastest growing AI startups and are hiring exceptional executors to join the team.&nbsp;
