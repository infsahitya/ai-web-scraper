Hightouch‚Äôs mission is to empower everyone to take action on their data. &nbsp;We‚Äôve pioneered the Composable Customer Data Platform (CDP), which helps companies use their own data warehouse to collect, prepare, and activate customer data for marketing personalization and business operations. Traditionally, acting on data has required engineering time and bandwidth, and left most business users stuck with charts and reports that are unable to take automated action on their data. With Hightouch, every business user, without writing any code, can activate data to streamline critical processes, improve marketing performance, and scale operations.

Our team operates with a focus on making a meaningful impact for our customers. We believe in approaching challenges with a first principles thinking mindset, moving quickly and embracing our value of efficient execution, and treating each other with compassion and kindness.
