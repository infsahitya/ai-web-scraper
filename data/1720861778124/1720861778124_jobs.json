    "description": "\nOur mission\nThe trucking and logistics industry provides the backbone of the economy. But the payments infrastructure on which it runs is broken. For the hard-working men and women of this sector, the existing suite of payment tools is outdated, difficult to use, prone to fraud, and saddled with shady fee structures. The incumbent players in this space often overlook the economic and practical needs of this user base. \n\n\nWe're changing that. AtoB is building Stripe for Transportation ‚Äî modernizing the payments infrastructure for trucking and logistics. Supply chains rely on the timely movement of capital to function efficiently. Our end game is a world in which that capital movement occurs fairly, smoothly, and without delay. As we pursue that end game, we aim to center our customers in every way ‚Äî offering them world-class customer experience and building products that work with and around the unique constraints of their daily lives. We build for fleet managers in the office\n Apply now and work remotely at AtoB",

The problem is clear: society is increasingly polarized, American colleges have seen a breakdown of dialogue between students, and even our democracy is at risk. Our future depends on the next generation being able to listen to and learn from one another, and to not turn away from dialogue.\n\n\nSchoolhouse, founded in 2020 by Sal Khan, is a leading free, non-profit educational platform for high schoolers to connect with each other over live Zoom sessions. While the focus has been on academic tutoring until now, Dialogues will expand these interactions to also include students engaging in conversations on contentious issues with others of the opposing view. The emphasis will be on the most divisive topics of the day: Israel-Palestine, abortion, Biden vs. Trump,\n Apply now and work remotely at Schoolhouse.world",
